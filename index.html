            <h3>Who We Are</h3>
            <p>Maharlika Cycling Team is a fun-loving crew of riders based in Legazpi City. We’re not bound by rules or rigid training schedules—we ride for the thrill, the laughs, and the shared stories on the road. Our team is made up of riders from all walks of life, united by two wheels and a love for the outdoors.</p>

            <h3>Our Ride Culture</h3>
            <p>We value friendship, inclusivity, and the joy of riding more than competition. You’ll find us cruising through city streets, climbing rural trails, or rolling deep into weekend “semi-legal” races hosted by other teams. Whether you're a newbie or a seasoned rider, you're welcome here.</p>

            <h3>What Makes Us Different</h3>
            <p>We’re not just a cycling group—we’re a rolling family. We don’t just train—we explore, connect, and share the road. From planning spontaneous rides to late-night food stops and after-ride hangouts, Maharlika is a vibe you ride with.</p>
